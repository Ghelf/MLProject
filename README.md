This is a Machine Learning Project about some classification and clustering algorithms:
> Classification:
>> (Binary) Decision Tree;
>> Naive Bayes.
> Clustering:
>> K-Medoids;
>> Fuzzy c-Means;
>> K-Means.
For the latest one, I give the credits to my teachers; it is included in the project for
comparison purposes.

This project has been developed in Matlab, so to make it work correctly it's necessary
> to have Matlab installed, 
> to put the whole MLProject-Ghelfi in the Matlab main folder.

The files in MLProject-Ghelfi are:
1. Main => it's the core of the project and it produces the plots for each algorithm;
2. ClassificationAnalysis => it allows to set the number of runs and computes the
			     failure rate of the proposed classification algorithms;
3. OtherClusteringAlgorithms => it tries other two clustering algorithms, Hierarchical
				clustering and Spectral clustering, but I have to give
				R. Salvaneschi the credits for these scripts.
These three files work separately, to make one work properly it's enough to click on the run button.
Auxiliary functions are in the folders, all the necessary paths have been added to
the main scripts.

There are some comments that allow the user to better understand the code meaning and (eventual) usage.
Hope it's clear enough.
